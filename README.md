 Playground: sparklyr
================

- In this repo I aim to play around with the new RStudio packake [sparklyr](http://spark.rstudio.com).   
  
- Check out the capabilities of the R interface for Apache Spark, but mainly this is for myself messing with this peace of technology.  
  
- Hopefully, I will document enough that it will make it easier to my future self in case I need to use this toolbox.  

Ideas 
------------

- [ &nbsp; ] Find worthy open dataset to demo  
- [ &nbsp; ] Config connection to the Google Cloud Spark cluster
